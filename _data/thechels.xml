  <p>AI-assisted coding for teams that can’t get away with vibes</p>

  <p>Atharva notes that AI is a multiplier: the more expertise you have in software engineering, the better the results you can get from LLMs. Furthermore, <em>what helps the human helps the AI</em>.</p>

  <p>This means good test coverage, automatic linting, continuous integration and deployment, good documentation practices and “clearly defined features, broken down into multiple small story cards”.</p>

  <p>If a team has all of this stuff in place, AI coding assistants will be able to operate more reliably and collaborate more effectively with their human overseers.</p>

<p>The app is a note taking companion app for bloggers who use Jekyll, the static site generator.</p>

<p>Notes or items, are saved to iCloud - one can then pick them up on a Mac and copy them into a git repo and commit them.</p>

<p>There is also an export function which opens the share sheet - which then can let the user copy the file into the <workingcopy.app> space and commit the file on the go.</workingcopy.app></p>

<p>There is an annual subscription and one off tips available, as well as bunch of customisable and accessible features.</p>
