  <li>
    <p>The OODA Loop</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Observe → Orient → Decide → Act</li>
      <li>A powerful cycle for rapid, adaptive decisions in changing landscapes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule)</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Focus on the 20% of actions yielding 80% of your results.</li>
      <li>Success isn’t about more activity; it’s about the right activity.</li>
      <li>Regularly reassess to ensure you’re focusing on the right 20%.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Amazon Door Framework</p>

    <p>Classify decisions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>One-way doors: Irreversible. Go slow, be thorough.</li>
      <li>Two-way doors: Reversible. Decide quickly, iterate.</li>
      <li>Most are two-way. Don’t treat them like they’re set in stone.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First Principles Thinking</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Break problems down to their absolute basic truths. Then rebuild your solution from that solid ground.</li>
      <li>Magic comes from questioning every assumption.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Eisenhower Matrix</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Urgent + Important: Do now</li>
      <li>nImportant, not urgent: Schedule</li>
      <li>Urgent, not important: Delegate</li>
      <li>Neither: Eliminate</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inversion Thinking</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Instead of “How do I succeed?” ask: “How could this fail?” Then avoid those pitfalls.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regret Minimization</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Show applied learning, like “Mastered AI and used it to boost user satisfaction 28%,” not just “Learned AI.”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
