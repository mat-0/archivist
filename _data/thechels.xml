  <p>If you want to create completely free software for other people to use, the absolute best delivery mechanism right now is static HTML and JavaScript served from a free web host with an established reputation.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thanks to WebAssembly the set of potential software that can be served in this way is vast and, I think, under appreciated. Pyodide means we can ship client-side Python applications now!</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This assumes that you would like your gift to the world to keep working for as long as possible, while granting you the freedom to lose interest and move onto other projects without needing to keep covering expenses far into the future.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Even the cheapest hosting plan requires you to monitor and update billing details every few years. Domains have to be renewed. Anything that runs server-side will inevitably need to be upgraded someday - and the longer you wait between upgrades the harder those become.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>My top choice for this kind of thing in 2025 is GitHub, using GitHub Pages. It’s free for public repositories and I haven’t seen GitHub break a working URL that they have hosted in the 17+ years since they first launched.</p>

<p>This release adds 8 more data structures, including vector set (beta), JSON, time series, and five probabilistic structures, including Bloom filter, cuckoo filter, count-min sketch, top-k, and t-digest (some previously available as separate Redis modules). These new data structures help you solve your current use cases better and build for the next generation of fast and real-time apps. </p>

  <p>HMRC’s newly published ‘Understanding the Use of the Lifetime ISA’ report lays bare the confusion at the heart of one of the government’s flagship savings products. Most striking is the revelation that even financially literate savers, including those actively contributing to their LISA, did not realise that the 25% penalty on non-qualifying withdrawals can leave them with less than they originally invested. People simply do not realise it’s not just a clawback of the government bonus – it’s a loss on their own money.</p>
