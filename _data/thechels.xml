<blockquote>
  <p>our proposal was recommended for funding, particularly as only <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/overview">36% </a>of new NSF grant applicants are successful on their first attempt. We became concerned, however, when we were presented with the terms and conditions we would be required to agree to if we accepted the grant. These terms included affirming the statement that we “do not, and will not during the term of this financial assistance award, operate any programs that advance or promote DEI, or discriminatory equity ideology in violation of Federal anti-discrimination laws.” This restriction would apply not only to the security work directly funded by the grant, but to any and all activity of the PSF as a whole. Further, violation of this term gave the NSF the right to “claw back” previously approved and transferred funds. This would create a situation where money we’d already spent could be taken back, which would be an enormous, open-ended financial risk.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Diversity, equity, and inclusion are core to the PSF’s values, as committed to in our <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/mission/">mission statement</a>:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>The mission of the Python Software Foundation is to promote, protect, and advance the Python programming language, and to support and facilitate the growth of <strong>a diverse and international community</strong> of Python programmers.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Given the value of the grant to the community and the PSF, we did our utmost to get clarity on the terms and to find a way to move forward in concert with our values. We consulted our NSF contacts and reviewed decisions made by other organizations in similar circumstances, particularly <a href="https://carpentries.org/blog/2025/06/announcing-withdrawal-of-nsf-pose-proposal/">The Carpentries</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the end, however, the PSF simply can’t agree to a statement that we won’t operate any programs that “advance or promote” diversity, equity, and inclusion, as it would be a betrayal of our mission and our community.</p>

<h3 id="legal-documents">Legal Documents</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Will. Ensure you have a current, legally valid will so your assets are distributed according to your wishes.</li>
  <li>Lasting Power of Attorney. This is critical in case you cannot function cognitively to manage your own affairs, allowing someone you trust to make decisions on your behalf.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="documentation">Documentation</h3>

<ul>
  <li>“When I Die” folder or notebook. Create centralized documentation of all essential information so your loved ones can find what they need (check out Meaningful Money website and podcast for more on this—they typically cover it once a year).</li>
  <li>Records of businesses, banks, bills, and assets. Maintain comprehensive records and set an annual reminder to review and update these so nothing is overlooked.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="communication-and-access">Communication and Access</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Quarterly sessions with spouse or next of kin. Schedule regular reviews of your financial situation together so they understand your affairs before an emergency arises.</li>
  <li>Joint names on bills. Where possible, add your spouse or next of kin to accounts so they can manage them without legal complications.</li>
  <li>Shared password vault. Use a password manager with shared access for accounts that can’t be joint, ensuring your family can access critical accounts when needed (good practice anyway).</li>
  <li>Shared email account. Consider setting one up for household management so important communications aren’t lost in a personal inbox.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="insurance">Insurance</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Comprehensive coverage. If you can afford it, protect your family against financial hardship by considering:
    <ul>
      <li>Critical illness cover to replace income if you’re diagnosed with a serious condition.</li>
      <li>Income protection to cover regular expenses if you can’t work.</li>
      <li>Death or life cover to provide financial security for dependents.</li>
      <li>Medical insurance to avoid depleting savings for healthcare costs.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pensions">Pensions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Expression of wishes. Ensure all pensions have up-to-date beneficiary designations, as pensions are at the administrator’s discretion and millions still list ex-spouses as beneficiaries, which often causes family disputes.</li>
  <li>Consolidation. Simplify by consolidating workplace pensions into one SIPP where appropriate, making them easier to track and manage (except defined benefit schemes—get professional advice if needed).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="digital-legacy">Digital Legacy</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Online legacy services. Some platforms like Meta (neé Facebook) allow you to transfer ownership to another user upon proof of death, preserving memories and access.</li>
  <li>Social media and digital accounts. Decide what you want to happen to each account so your digital presence is handled according to your wishes.</li>
  <li>Digital downsizing. Take stock of all accounts and eliminate unnecessary ones, reducing the burden on those managing your estate.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="final-wishes">Final Wishes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Document your preferences. Put in writing what you want when the inevitable happens so your family isn’t left guessing during an emotional time:
    <ul>
      <li>Burial or cremation preferences.</li>
      <li>Wake or memorial service details.</li>
      <li>Music playlist for the service.</li>
      <li>Poems and readings you’d like included.</li>
      <li>Any other specific requests or wishes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Curiosity, genuine, relentless curiosity, is the single most important skill in this profession…</strong> You have to be deeply interested in people, behaviours, patterns, and anomalies. It’s that instinct to ask why, to dig one layer deeper than everyone else, that often leads to the breakthrough. You can teach someone the technical elements, but curiosity, in my opinion, can’t be taught. It’s either part of your mindset, or it’s not.</p>
