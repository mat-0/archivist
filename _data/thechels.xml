<p>The app is a note taking companion app for bloggers who use Jekyll, the static site generator.</p>

<p>Notes or items, are saved to iCloud - one can then pick them up on a Mac and copy them into a git repo and commit them.</p>

<p>There is also an export function which opens the share sheet - which then can let the user copy the file into the <workingcopy.app> space and commit the file on the go.</workingcopy.app></p>

<p>There is an annual subscription and one off tips available, as well as bunch of customisable and accessible features.</p>

Good things! I’m not retiring from writing apps — which means I’ll have a lot more time for working on NetNewsWire.</p>

I don’t think that’s a bad thing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Engineers often feel a lot of ownership over the code they write. That’s understandable: it’s partially their creation, and it’s also their workspace, so they have a direct interest in it being a nice place to work in.</p>

  <p>This causes engineers to push back hard against attempts to ship “quick fixes” or to rush features out that would cause some technical debt. To them, it feels like their elegant codebase is being vandalized - as if someone came into their house and started tracking mud everywhere.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nothing beats a folder full of markdown files
Obsidian reinforces a lesson I’ve learned from my last decade and a half of blogging; nothing beats a folder full of markdown files. A note-taking app doesn’t have to be complex machinery. A little bit of YAML frontmatter can go a long way.</p>

  <p>This migration identified one subtle problem I didn’t know I had; I “over-databased” in Notion. I created entire sections in Notion with a database to get the editable table UI. This creates a lot of click-thru flows, excess documents, and feels like building an entire CMS for a one-page website. Obsidian nudges me to think more simple.</p>

  <p>What’s more, there’s the environmental impacts of AI, which are only just beginning to emerge. An MIT article titled Explained: Generative AI’s environmental impact outlines how the rapid expansion of generative AI presents significant sustainability challenges, including electricity and water overuse, hardware-related emissions, and increasing pressure on power grids.</p>

  <p>The world is already cooked. And yet, we’re cooking it more — literally, and figuratively — by shipping insecure software into the void that we have no idea how to debug, scale, or extend. In the not-so-distant future, LLMs will be trained purely on LLM-generated software, and the world will eat itself.</p>

  <p>Today, Entra ID (Azure AD) MFA supports delivering one-time passcodes (OTPs) via text message. These texts get sent to the default messaging app on a user’s phone depending on the phone’s operating system. In many countries though, these default apps aren’t users’ primary messaging apps. To help deliver OTPs to users on their preferred messaging platforms, Entra ID will roll out OTP delivery to WhatsApp in select regions.</p>

  <p>Starting mid-September 2023, users in India, Indonesia, and New Zealand may start receiving MFA text messages via WhatsApp. Users that fit the following criteria are subject, but not guaranteed, to receive the updated experience</p>
