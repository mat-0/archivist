  <p>HMRC’s newly published ‘Understanding the Use of the Lifetime ISA’ report lays bare the confusion at the heart of one of the government’s flagship savings products. Most striking is the revelation that even financially literate savers, including those actively contributing to their LISA, did not realise that the 25% penalty on non-qualifying withdrawals can leave them with less than they originally invested.

The HTML spec used to define an outline algorithm that gave &lt;h1&gt; elements an implicit semantic heading level based on how many sectioning elements (&lt;section&gt;, &lt;aside&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, and &lt;article&gt;) it was nested inside.</p>

  <p>AI crawler wars threaten to make the web more closed for everyone
There’s an accelerating cat-and-mouse game between web publishers and AI crawlers, and we all stand to lose. </p>

  <p>We often take the internet for granted. It’s an ocean of information at our fingertips—and it simply works. But this system relies on swarms of “crawlers”—bots that roam the web, visit millions of websites every day, and report what they see. This is how Google powers its search engines, how Amazon sets competitive prices, and how Kayak aggregates travel listings. Beyond the world of commerce, crawlers are essential for monitoring web security, enabling accessibility tools, and preserving historical archives. Academics, journalists, and civil societies also rely on them to conduct crucial investigative research.  </p>

  <p>Crawlers are endemic. Now representing half of all internet traffic, they will soon outpace human traffic. This unseen subway of the web ferries information from site to site, day and night. And as of late, they serve one more purpose: Companies such as OpenAI use web-crawled data to train their artificial intelligence systems, like ChatGPT.</p>
