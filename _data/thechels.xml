<h2 id="important-guidelines-for-low-histamine-vegan-eating">Important Guidelines for Low Histamine Vegan Eating</h2>

<h3 id="fresh-is-best">Fresh is Best</h3>

<p>Prepare meals fresh and avoid leftovers whenever possible. Histamine levels increase as food ages, even in the refrigerator. Try to cook just enough for one meal at a time.</p>

<h3 id="cooking-methods-matter">Cooking Methods Matter</h3>

<p>Steam, boil, or bake foods rather than frying or grilling to minimize histamine formation during the cooking process.</p>]]></content><author><name>Mat</name></author><category term="low histamine" /><category term="vegan" /><category term="meal plan" /><category term="anti-inflammatory" /><category term="food sensitivity" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Managing histamine intolerance on a vegan diet requires careful planning.

<blockquote>
  <p>If you want to create completely free software for other people to use, the absolute best delivery mechanism right now is static HTML and JavaScript served from a free web host with an established reputation.</p>

  <p>Thanks to WebAssembly the set of potential software that can be served in this way is vast and, I think, under appreciated. Pyodide means we can ship client-side Python applications now!</p>

  <p>This assumes that you would like your gift to the world to keep working for as long as possible, while granting you the freedom to lose interest and move onto other projects without needing to keep covering expenses far into the future.</p>

  <p>Even the cheapest hosting plan requires you to monitor and update billing details every few years. Domains have to be renewed. Anything that runs server-side will inevitably need to be upgraded someday - and the longer you wait between upgrades the harder those become.</p>

  <p>My top choice for this kind of thing in 2025 is GitHub, using GitHub Pages. It’s free for public repositories and I haven’t seen GitHub break a working URL that they have hosted in the 17+ years since they first launched.</p>
