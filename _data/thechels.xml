Sharing here as I’ve found that I have inadvertently been doing this myself when wanting to move on with an agent and not have it carry existing context into a new request.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They poison their own context. Maybe you can call it context rot, where as context grows and especially if it grows with lots of distractions and dead ends, the output quality falls off rapidly. Even with good context the rot will start to become apparent around 100k tokens (with Gemini 2.5).</p>

  <p>They really need to figure out a way to delete or “forget” prior context, so the user or even the model can go back and prune poisonous tokens.</p>

  <p>Right now I work around it by regularly making summaries of instances, and then spinning up a new instance with fresh context and feed in the summary of the previous instance.

  <p>AI-assisted coding for teams that can’t get away with vibes</p>

  <p>Atharva notes that AI is a multiplier: the more expertise you have in software engineering, the better the results you can get from LLMs. Furthermore, <em>what helps the human helps the AI</em>.</p>

  <p>This means good test coverage, automatic linting, continuous integration and deployment, good documentation practices and “clearly defined features, broken down into multiple small story cards”.</p>

  <p>If a team has all of this stuff in place, AI coding assistants will be able to operate more reliably and collaborate more effectively with their human overseers.</p>

  <p>I wrote this recently in a conversation about whether coding agents can work as a replacement for human programmers.</p>

  <p>The “agentic” coding tools we have right now work like this:</p>

  <p>A skilled individual with both deep domain understanding and deep understanding of the capabilities of the agent (including understanding what tools are available to that agent) poses a clear task to it.
The agent writes some code relating to that task. It runs a tool to execute and test that code. It inspects the result, and if there are errors it edits the code and tries again.
It may call other tools as well, for example a search tool to find related code or even to look up API documentation elsewhere (including via web search).
It continues like this until it hits a loosely defined “done” state or gets stuck.
The skilled individual then reviews what it has done and almost always finds that it has not solved the problem to their satisfaction… so they apply their expertise and domain understanding to prompt it again to try and get to that desired state.
Without the skilled individual, the “agent” is useless. It may as well not exist.</p>

<p>The extension captures selected text on a page and via the context menu allows the use to save this as a quote and creates a markdown file with Jekyll front matter.</p>

<p>Save it to your Hiyd iCloud Drive folder to sync with the mobile app.</p>

<p>Save it to your git repo to publish to your Jekyll blog.</p>

<p>Code is open source on GitHub and it collects no data of any kind.
You can find the source code on <a href="https://github.com/Hiyd-uk/hiyd-extension">GitHub here</a>.</p>]]></content><author><name>Mat</name></author><category term="hiyd" /><category term="jekyll" /><category term="extension" /><category term="chrome" /><category term="markdown" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I’m happy to announce that Hiyd extension is now generally available via the Chrome Web Store.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Monthly Mixtape - June 2025</title><link href="https://thechels.uk/mixtape-music-06-2025" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Monthly Mixtape - June 2025" /><published>2025-06-19T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-06-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://thechels.uk/mixtape-music-06-2025</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://thechels.uk/mixtape-music-06-2025"><![CDATA[<p>What I’ve been listening to this month.</p>

<p>The app is a note taking companion app for bloggers who use Jekyll, the static site generator.</p>

<p>Notes or items, are saved to iCloud - one can then pick them up on a Mac and copy them into a git repo and commit them.</p>

<p>There is also an export function which opens the share sheet - which then can let the user copy the file into the <workingcopy.app> space and commit the file on the go.</workingcopy.app></p>

<p>There is an annual subscription and one off tips available, as well as bunch of customisable and accessible features.</p>
