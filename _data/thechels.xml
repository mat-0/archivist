<blockquote>
  <p>If you’re going to build for the web, build on the web and build with the web.</p>

  <p>If I was only able to give one bit of advice to any company: iterate quickly on a slow-moving platform.</p>

  <p>In the last year alone, I have seen two completely different clients in two completely different industries sink months and months into framework upgrades. Collectively, they’ve spent tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of dollars rewriting entire projects just to maintain feature parity with the previous iteration. This is not meaningful or productive work—it is time sunk into merely keeping themselves at square one.</p>

  <p>They’re iterating slowly on a fast-moving platform.</p>

Sharing here as I’ve found that I have inadvertently been doing this myself when wanting to move on with an agent and not have it carry existing context into a new request.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They poison their own context. Maybe you can call it context rot, where as context grows and especially if it grows with lots of distractions and dead ends, the output quality falls off rapidly. Even with good context the rot will start to become apparent around 100k tokens (with Gemini 2.5).</p>

  <p>They really need to figure out a way to delete or “forget” prior context, so the user or even the model can go back and prune poisonous tokens.</p>

  <p>Right now I work around it by regularly making summaries of instances, and then spinning up a new instance with fresh context and feed in the summary of the previous instance.

  <p>AI-assisted coding for teams that can’t get away with vibes</p>

  <p>Atharva notes that AI is a multiplier: the more expertise you have in software engineering, the better the results you can get from LLMs. Furthermore, <em>what helps the human helps the AI</em>.</p>

  <p>This means good test coverage, automatic linting, continuous integration and deployment, good documentation practices and “clearly defined features, broken down into multiple small story cards”.</p>

  <p>If a team has all of this stuff in place, AI coding assistants will be able to operate more reliably and collaborate more effectively with their human overseers.</p>

  <p>I wrote this recently in a conversation about whether coding agents can work as a replacement for human programmers.</p>

  <p>The “agentic” coding tools we have right now work like this:</p>

  <p>A skilled individual with both deep domain understanding and deep understanding of the capabilities of the agent (including understanding what tools are available to that agent) poses a clear task to it.
The agent writes some code relating to that task. It runs a tool to execute and test that code. It inspects the result, and if there are errors it edits the code and tries again.
It may call other tools as well, for example a search tool to find related code or even to look up API documentation elsewhere (including via web search).
It continues like this until it hits a loosely defined “done” state or gets stuck.
The skilled individual then reviews what it has done and almost always finds that it has not solved the problem to their satisfaction… so they apply their expertise and domain understanding to prompt it again to try and get to that desired state.
Without the skilled individual, the “agent” is useless. It may as well not exist.</p>
