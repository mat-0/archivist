<h2 id="important-guidelines-for-low-histamine-vegan-eating">Important Guidelines for Low Histamine Vegan Eating</h2>

<h3 id="fresh-is-best">Fresh is Best</h3>

<p>Prepare meals fresh and avoid leftovers whenever possible. Histamine levels increase as food ages, even in the refrigerator. Try to cook just enough for one meal at a time.</p>

<h3 id="cooking-methods-matter">Cooking Methods Matter</h3>

<p>Steam, boil, or bake foods rather than frying or grilling to minimize histamine formation during the cooking process.</p>]]></content><author><name>Mat</name></author><category term="low histamine" /><category term="vegan" /><category term="meal plan" /><category term="anti-inflammatory" /><category term="food sensitivity" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Managing histamine intolerance on a vegan diet requires careful planning.
